# Let's Not Make Masks Permanent 
For my project I made a visual argument that focuses on the issue of air pollution. I felt that given the current coronavirus pandemic I could make an argument that is more effective if I related it to the airborne virus in someway. For this reason, I incorporated a mask into my argument because, just as now people wear masks to protect themselves against the virus, in the future (for the United States) and currently for countries like Taiwan people also wear masks to protect themselves from polluted air. Additionally, the amount of air pollution has become deadly in some countries and accounts for 3.4 million deaths annually. For this reason, I used a tombstone as the background for my image and incorporated the dying tree to show the impact of the polluted air on nature. The text “Let’s Not Make Masks Permanent” is meant to imply the fact that if we do not work to fix the issue of air pollution we may still have to wear masks when we go outside even after the coronavirus pandemic has subsided.
